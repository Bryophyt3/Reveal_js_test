# Summary
- We are requesting several new tech tools for staff use, to optimize our effectiveness and efficiency, with secondary QOL benefits.
- This requires Deputy approval for strategic fit with agency, 
- followed by IT / WaTech security review and approval.
- Staff conducted preliminary research to ensure viability of those approvals before preparing the request.

# Request Overview
- We are requesting approval for Elgato Stream Deck, AutoHotKey, and Obsidian MD.
- < *insert images for each* >
- Each of these tools bring great impacts and benefits, and is a worthy choice on its own.
- But as a group, they work together phenomenally, to create more than they could apart.
 
# Stream Deck - Intro
- The Stream Deck from Elgato is arguably the world's greatest macro pad.
- While a standard keyboard sends one character per key - an A, a B, or a C at a time, for example, macros can send multiple keys, and good ones like the Stream Deck can do a lot more.
- The simplest use is to take keyboard shortcuts or "hotkeys" that normally require multiple keypresses, and combine them into one: Ctrl + C becomes a single button for Copy, Ctrl + V becomes paste, Ctrl + Shift + S opens the snipping tool, and Shift + Alt + Down Arrow + Down Arrow + Enter sorts an Excel column A to Z.
- (While most people know some of the simpler ones, the harder ones start to feel like you have to jam in the Konami code before your game starts up!)
- (It also becomes harder to remember the different shortcuts for all the different programs you use...)
 
# Stream Deck - Moar Power!
- The Stream Deck solves this problem by making each button its own little screen, so it has a label right on it!
- Even more impressively, it can hold profiles for each app, and it will actually switch the buttons to match the app you are using!
- This way whichever size of Stream Deck you use, it can be like dozens of custom keyboards all glued together into one!
- Tarran here is famous for setting up multiple keyboards, with every key custom programmed in AutoHotKey (which we'll come back to) < *insert image* >
- But now he has all of that programmed into one Stream Deck! < *insert image* >

# Stream Deck - Software
- The Stream Deck software is what makes the Stream Deck not just great, but the best.
- It is designed to talk to all the apps behind the scenes, so you can do things like control your microphone, start your YouTube stream, switch to the "On a break" screen and music, and so on - without having to actively switch to the apps themselves - and could combine all that into a single button.
- That has made it very popular for people doing virtual meetings and other live video streaming, and is gaining traction among productivity enthusiasts. 

# Stream Deck - Anyone can be a super user
- The custom labels and automatic switching make the Stream Deck very intuitive and enjoyable to use.
- With a Stream Deck set up with all the macros and buttons ready to go, anyone can be a Super User.
- This maximizes the productivity of all the members of a team, and multiplies the impact of your current power users, since they can now share and make more of their knowledge usable by others.
- Another fun note is that the software on each computer controls the Stream Deck device, rather than the other way around, so multiple users can share a single device and it will feel custom designed for each of them!  

# Stream Deck - What can't it do?
- As incredible as it is, the Stream Deck is ultimately still just a keyboard.
- It can combine a lot of different things that a user would achieve with a keyboard and mouse, but it can't *think*.
- In order to do more complex things like look at information and make a decision, you need a more specialized tool.
- And that is why AutoHotKey is fantastic to pair with a Stream Deck!
 
# AutoHotKey - Introduction
- As described by Wikipedia AutoHotkey is a free and open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows, initially aimed at providing easy keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys, fast macro-creation, and software automation that allows users of most levels of computer skill to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application.
- More simply put, it can make your keyboard seemingly do basically anything you can imagine.

# AutoHotKey - Uses
- AutoHotKey gives you full control over the keyboard and mouse, and the ability to add logic to the commands, which custom keyboards or even the Stream Deck would not do.
 
# AutoHotKey - Not Just Macros
- For example, with a PRISM project number in Excel, you could click a "Motorized Single Use" button on a Stream Deck that would quickly open the webpage, hit tab the right number of times to get to the correct one (you have to count how many that is and program it in), and then it would click the box, then tab the right number of times to land on the save button, and then send the Enter key.
- That's impressive, but you have to do all the thinking for it, it has to be able to reach the right checkbox with simple keyboard commands, and if you had already clicked it before, it would now *uncheck* your checkbox.
- AutoHotKey, on the other hand, could take a project number, use the data in PRISM to determine the correct Cultural Resources pathway, navigate through old PRISM - even the majority of which that can't be controlled by a keyboard - determine whether the correct pathway had already been selected, and check the box if it still needed to.
- That addition of logic is what elevates AutoHotKey from macros to scripting.

# AutoHotKey - What can't it do?
- As awesome as it is, AutoHotKey still needs a keyboard shortcut to start the ball rolling. You have to remember that it's Ctrl + J that fills in the Cultural Resources Pathway, versus Ctrl + *SHIFT* + J could be programmed to do something totally different.
- And that's where the Stream Deck becomes the perfect partner to AutoHotKey, providing all of that logic, speed, and power with the simple, clear buttons it has always needed!

# Obsidian - What is it, and why does it belong here?
- Obsidian is like how the Stream Deck makes it so anybody can be a super user, helping them be fast and powerful, with X-ray vision that cuts through the hundreds of unused buttons, commands, and settings found in typical programs.
- And Obsidian is like AutoHotKey just needing that nice, custom button to unlock the incredible efficiency and versatility of Markdown plaintext language.
- Those are bold claims, but what does it mean?
 
# Obsidian - a Markdown editor
- Markdown is a text markup language, that splits the text and the formatting into two different things, while at the same time you can control the formatting with just the text itself!
- Take a typical word processing program: you type in the words, select certain ones to be bold or italicized, and so on.  But often we end up fighting the autoformatting, when it inexplicably changes the tab distance, or stopping to format words before trying to find our place and train of thought again.
- Markdown uses simple special characters, like asterisks before and after text that you want italicized.  Instead of going up to the menu, clicking through to find the right style, and then going back down to where you were typing, Markdown uses one pound sign for a Heading 1, two for a Heading 2, and so on.
- While Notepad has the ability to read and write Markdown, it can't render it, and it will always be about to save your md file as a txt!
- Obsidian is a Markdown editor in that it is designed for the job, giving you a full rendered view, or something in between.  Personally, I like to still see the formatting characters, while also having bold be bold and so on.  Obsidian is designed for Markdown files, and will never hesitate to work correctly.

# Markdown - Simple, Reliable, Versatile
- Building from the simplest plain text, Markdown is minimalist and efficient.  It is easy to read no matter what, and the formatting symbols are intuitive additions even if you don't render them out.
< *insert image* >
- By comparison a Word or PowerPoint file achieves its finished, formatted look by hiding an unintelligible mess of XML behind it. < *insert image* >
- Also, Word is Word, and you cannot share content back and forth with PowerPoint or Excel without having to reformat it each time.  It also means that you need the proprietary program that made it - and if anything goes wrong, the content of the file is basically lost.
- Furthermore, the same Markdown text can be rendered as a printed report, or as a website (which was Markdown's original purpose), or even as a slideshow, without having to change the text at all!  In a keynote presentation, a Markdown developer shows how one file of plain text was able to be rendered into 14 different formats!

# Markdown - Mind-blowing Efficiency
- Markdown is drastically more efficient than other common file types.  
- PowerPoint files contain their text content, the slide styles and animations, every image, and every bit of formatting.  The resulting files are frequently so large as to cause problems, where they can't be attached to email, or PRISM starts to crash when people attempt to upload them.
- The bloat and burden are so great as to become anti-equity.  When one of my tribal sponsors couldn't participate in Tech Review because their internet infrastructure couldn't handle sending us the slideshow, I started looking for alternatives.  To my surprise, I found the Markdown files I already greatly enjoyed for writing could also be shown as a slideshow, and that it would just load the photos from online hosts, like a website does.  
- I made a quick prototype example that covered all the same info and numerous photos and illustrations, was stunned to find that with the same amount of content - just not using the custom PowerPoint formatting - I could fit 15 THOUSAND Markdown slideshows in the same space as a single PowerPoint file.  
- In Markdown, every single slideshow in the history of RCO could fit in the space of one PowerPoint, and any sponsor with the slightest internet access would be able to work with them easily.

# Obsidian - What else is special?
- The file system in Obsidian is drastically better than what we are used to.
- Not only are the files so light to work with, Obsidian also indexes them for searching, like how Google can search the entire internet faster than we can find our own files or emails.
- Furthermore, whereas File Explorer will let you save something like "20-1968 Federal Time Extension Request" under one of those topics (or start making copies to put in multiple locations), the tag system in Obsidian lets you save it under ***all*** of those...
